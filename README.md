 We have over __250,000__ pieces (Airbnb listings) from 10 big cities around the world, plus 5 million little notes (guest reviews). These pieces tell us a lot about how people rent out their homes for short stays.

# What the Data Tells Us
Let's break down Airbnb's journey like a story with a few chapters:

__Chapter 1: The New Kid on the Block (Early Days)__
When Airbnb first started, it was a brand new idea. Because it was new and not many places were available, both the number of Airbnbs and their prices kept going up. People were excited to try something different!

Chapter 2: Becoming a Household Name (After a While)
Once everyone knew about Airbnb, more and more people wanted to list their homes. This meant a lot more Airbnbs became available. With more choices, prices started to go down a bit, making it more common for travelers.

Chapter 3: The Rulebook Changes (Around 2015)
Around 2015, cities started making new rules for short-term rentals. This made some hosts unsure, so the number of Airbnbs actually decreased. Because there were fewer places, but still lots of people wanting them, prices went up again. It was a bit confusing for everyone.

Chapter 4: Getting Used to the New Rules (Around 2019)
After a while, everyone got used to the new rules. The number of Airbnbs started to grow again because people knew what to expect. With more places available once more, prices began to drop because there was more competition.

What Airbnb Should Do Next
Based on this story, here are some ideas for Airbnb to keep growing smartly:

Be Ready for New Rules:

The Problem: If cities make tough rules about renting out homes for short periods, it could make hosts and guests leave. This means Airbnb could lose money and trust.
The Solution: Airbnb needs to watch out for new rules in other cities. They should be prepared for changes and have plans ready so they don't get caught off guard.
Keep Customers Happy:

The Problem: If new rules make it harder or less fun to use Airbnb, people might think badly of the brand.
The Solution: Airbnb should always make sure the experience for guests and hosts stays great, no matter what rules come up. A good experience is key to keeping everyone coming back.
Smart Growth, Not Just Growth:

Idea 1: Learn from Good Rules. If some rules work well in one city, Airbnb could try to use similar ideas in other places.
Idea 2: Be Picky with Hosts. Airbnb could be stricter about who can list their homes and how they manage them. This ensures quality and builds more trust.
Idea 3: Don't Overwhelm Areas. To keep cities happy and make sure there are still places for people to live, Airbnb could limit how many listings are in one neighborhood. This helps avoid problems with local governments.
